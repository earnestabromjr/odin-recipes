This project is a reflection of my journey as a WebDev. I currently am using edX to complete a MicroBachelors in full stack web development. Alongside that learning path is TheOdinProject and Harvard's well reknown CS50 (im taking the python track). 

I will be updating this README along the way.

Stay tuned.
